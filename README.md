Tech Future is a beginner-friendly repository tracking my journey into software development. It contains class exercises, practice projects, and learning notes, and is updated after every class as I grow my skills and explore modern technologies step by step. 🚀

On first day I learned from each and everyone journey
Day two:
Starting with practical on hand by learning what is Github and how to use it.

The learning process is well structured and Organized. 
## Day 1

<p>I learned from each and everyone journey,People has different vision and own missions, but the most important thing is to always focus on the journey </p>

## Day2

<p>before I didn't understand on how to Use Github. But in the Class I came to realize so many Github functions </p>

## Day 3

<p> Assigning each one as project partner to each other, we are to collaborate with each another on our Repo.
  It is a very good initiative especially in learning how to code on.
